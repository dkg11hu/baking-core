# Baking Core | XS Driver
Logic-blind technical driver for artisan bread production.

## Documentation
- [System Architecture](.docs/Architecture.md) - Workflow Track 1 vs Track 2.
- [Data Schemas](.docs/Schemas.md) - SSoT Fieldname definitions.

A logic-blind, recursive graph-traversal engine designed for professional bakery production. 

## 🏗 The Philosophy: Logic-Blind Architecture
This engine is built on the principle that **the code should know nothing about the data's meaning.** - All fieldnames, rounding thresholds, and hierarchical relationships are defined in the **JSON Database**.
- The JS logic acts purely as a "slave" to the `definitions.json` schema.
- This allows for infinite recipe nesting (e.g., Yudane inside Sourdough inside a Final Loaf) without changing a single line of code.

## 🛠 Project Structure
- `/data/Store/`: The "Database" containing the Registry and individual Product Entities.
- `/src/Graph/Core/`: The `Resolver` that handles the recursive "Series of Queries."
- `/src/Graph/Logic/`: The `Calculator` that manages high-precision scaling and physics rounding.
- `app.js`: The UI Orchestrator.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run a local web server (e.g., `npx serve .`).
3. Open the browser to visualize the **Process Hierarchy** and **Cumulative Requisition**.

## 📊 Features
- **Recursive Resolution**: Automatically dives into sub-assemblies.
- **Universal Rounding**: Synchronized rounding between the tree view and the shopping list.
- **Environment Agnostic**: The Resolver works in both Node.js (CLI) and the Browser.
