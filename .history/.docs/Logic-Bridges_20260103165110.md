# WIKI: 02. Navigation Logic (Logic-Blind)

Path: /.docs/Logic-Bridges.md

The system utilizes a central "Bridge" in app.js to handle navigation without hardcoded URL routes.

openBrowser(): Toggles visibility from Step 0 to Step 1.

changeStep(delta):

Delta +1: Advances the user through the tracks. In Track 1, it triggers lockAndStart(), which snapshots the current parameters and freezes them for Track 2.

Delta -1: Navigates backward. If at the start of a track, it resets the view to the previous higher-level selection layer.

location.reload(): Used as a hard-reset to return to the Root Gateway (Step 0) upon completion or total exit.
