# System Architecture: Dual-Track Driver

## 1. Logic-Blind Philosophy

The application is a "dumb" executor. It contains no hardcoded recipes or timings. It functions by resolving the relationship between **Entities** (Registry) and **Instructions** (Technologies).

## 2. Workflow Tracks

### Track #1: Parametrization (Variable)

**Phase:** Pre-Production / Discovery

- **Input:** `physics_categories` (e.g., `PHYS_TEMP_ROOM`, `PHYS_MASS_TARGET`).

- **Operation:** Recursive Formula Resolution.
- **Goal:** Transform the base formula into a `Resolved_Instance`.
- **UI View:** `params-view`.

### Track #2: Production (Locked)

**Phase:** Execution

- **Input:** `technology_ref` (mapped to `steps`).

- **Operation:** Sequential Navigation (Linear DAG).
- **Goal:** Guided execution via video and tech-stats.
- **UI View:** `workflow-view`.

## 3. Navigation State Machine

- **Index -1:** Gateway Choice (History vs. Start).
- **Index 0...N:** Locked Production Steps.

- **Exit:** `location.reload()` returns to Global Browser.
